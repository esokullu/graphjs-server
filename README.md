# GraphJS-Server

An event-driven, non-blocking GraphJS Server. 

Extends [Pho REST Server](https://github.com/phonetworks/pho-server-rest) APIs. For more information, check out http://graphjs.com

GraphJS-Server does not rely on a third party HTTP Server such as [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/) or [Apache HTTPD](https://httpd.apache.org/). But it is recommended that you run it behind a proxy server for static assets and caching.
